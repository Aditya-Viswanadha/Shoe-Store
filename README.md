# Shoe-Store
Project Overview: The purpose of our project is to design a relational database that will provide backend engineering and support for an e-commerce web application that sells a diverse selection of shoes as products. The application will provide a means for users (customers) to create a profile, browse and shop for shoes from the e-commerce inventory, browse and shop for shoes according to their customized profile, and then complete a purchase order of one or more pairs of shoes. A unique aspect of our e-commerce design is the ability for customers to specify a certain preference for shoes (sorted by shoe type, size, color, etc.) in order to enhance user experience on the web application. 
Our e-commerce web application design includes certain business functions that allow the customer to easily navigate the application, review their purchase and order history, participate in discounts and specials, as well as manage their profile.
